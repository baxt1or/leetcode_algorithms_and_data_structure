## 🧠 Problem Statement

Alice has `n` candies, where the `iᵗʰ` candy is of type `candyType[i]`.  
Since Alice started to gain weight, she visited a doctor.

The doctor advised Alice to eat only `n / 2` of the candies she has (`n` is always even).  
However, Alice loves her candies and wants to eat as many **different types** as possible while still following the doctor's advice.

Return the **maximum number of different types** of candies she can eat.

**Input:** candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
**Output:** 3 


## 🔍 Example 3
**Input:** candyType = [6,6,6,6]
**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**  
Alice can eat 2 candies, but all are of the same type, so she can only have 1 unique type.
